7pm @ Cowork Bloomington (Thanks Cowork!)

## Summary
We reviewed the ideas behind a civic hacking group, discussed plans for getting the word out about an initial kick off meeting in March, and then brainstormed ideas of projects that the group would like to see.

## Projects discussed

Move to Bloomington... sites that could profile people's lives in Bloomington. It could also be a directory of ideas for businesses that the city needs more of; encourage those who want to do that to come here. We could copy what other cities have done well. There was mention of a site that is a directory of people working on things, but someone takes the time to do interviews and take photos, so it's compelling to read. 

Service to help people navigate unemployment processes

Service to help people find recycling resources for those who live in large apartment complexes that don't offer recycling services

System to organize grassroots communities

Site to describe how to run for an election (participate in government)

A directory of community developed civic software solutions. Many cities are solving the same problems; would be nice to reuse solutions. (previously gosscon, civic commons)

Welcome Wagon: once new residents arrive in Bloomington, welcome them to the community. Could go through apartment rental companies and real estate sales to find new residents. Other organizations may want to support the effort, for example the monroe county board of realtors, the city puts together a new student guide, new-comers club, local first, non-profit orgs, faith based orgs, bloomington chamber of commerce. Pool those resources into a welcome basket.
