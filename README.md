# [Civic Hacking in Bloomington, Indiana](https://city-of-bloomington.github.io/civic-hacking/)

To paraphrase [this article on opengovdata.io](https://opengovdata.io/2014/civic-hacking/):

"Civic hackers are programmers, designers, data scientists, good communicators, civic organizers, entrepreneurs, government employees and anyone willing to get her hands dirty solving problems. "
